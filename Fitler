While using Calculate Function, its filter parameter will not work with dynamic value, so Fitler is use if we want to use a dynamic value as filter parameter.

High Ticket Size Product_Filter = 
    CALCULATE(
        [Total Sales Quantity],
        FILTER('Product Lookup','Product Lookup'[ProductPrice]>[Overall Avg Price])
        )
