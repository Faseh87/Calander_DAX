To create average from a particular column which have blank spaces OR we do want to add specific values in that column:
	
Average Satisfaction = CALCULATE(													(this will calculate what we will provide inside brackets)
    AVERAGE('Patient Dataset'[patient_sat_score]),                                  		(coulmn we want to average),
        'Patient Dataset'[patient_sat_score]<>BLANK()										(column we want to exclude)
        )
